Sandbox project

Fun little AR application I made to experiment with hidden objects. At the moment, all it does is build a room with a ball inside of it whenever one taps the screen. The rooms are inside-out, so you cannot see whatever is inside of it unless you are looking through the door / window. It's a cool concept, so feel free to use the code and experiment.
